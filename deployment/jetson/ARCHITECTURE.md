# Architecture — Jetson Advisory Deployment

How the prototype works internally, why it is shaped this way, and how it
maps onto the simulation. Written to be sufficient for resuming work cold.

## 1. Design priorities

1. **Latency over accuracy** (project decision). Every choice below trades
   estimation quality for milliseconds; the budget table in §4 shows the result.
2. **Sim-contract fidelity.** The actor must see the same 39-dim observation
   it saw in training, including the spec's neutral fallbacks for unsensed
   fields. The contract is vendored and test-locked (§6).
3. **Degrade, never die.** Missing GPS, no camera, no display, no trained
   checkpoint - each has a defined degraded mode, because in-car debugging
   time is expensive.

## 2. Dataflow

```
 camera thread          GPS thread              V2V rx thread (optional)
 (latest frame slot)    (latest fix + NMEA log) (peer table, TTL 2s)
        |                     |                     |
        v                     v                     v
 +------------------- pipeline thread (pipeline.py) -------------------+
 |  TensorRT YOLOv8n FP16  ->  IoU tracker  ->  pinhole distance/      |
 |  (detector.py)              (tracker.py)     lateral + d/dt slope   |
 |                                              (distance.py)          |
 |                    -> observation_builder.py                        |
 |                       39-field sim obs + provenance tags            |
 |                    -> actor_runtime.py (numpy MLP mirror)           |
 |                    -> advisory.py (decode = sim wrappers)           |
 +------------+------------------+------------------+-----------------+
              |                  |                  |
              v                  v                  v
        TickSlot (UI)      metadata.jsonl      UDP telemetry
              |            video.avi           (port 47900)
              v
        main thread: dashboard render (ui/dashboard.py)
```

Handoffs are all **latest-value-wins** (no queues on the hot path): a frame
that was never processed is dropped, a dashboard that renders slowly skips
ticks, a stalled SD card drops log records. Stale data is worse than missing
data for a real-time advisory.

Threading: capture, GPS, logging, video encode, jtop sampling, V2V are
threads; the heavy stages (cv2 resize, TensorRT execute, numpy) release the
GIL, so a single process suffices. The OpenCV GUI must own the main thread,
so the pipeline runs on a worker and the dashboard polls a `TickSlot`.

## 4. Latency budget (measured 2026-06-11, this device)

End-to-end p50 **19.8 ms** / p95 20.2 ms at 48.5 FPS (`models/bench_results.json`).

| stage | p50 | notes / applied optimizations |
|---|---|---|
| detection | 17.7 ms | GPU compute is only 3.9 ms (trtexec); the rest is letterbox resize + `cv2.dnn.blobFromImage` preprocessing (was 23 ms with numpy preprocessing) and CPU NMS. Pinned host buffers, single CUDA stream. |
| tracking + distance | 1.1 ms | greedy IoU, no Hungarian/Kalman |
| observation + encode | 0.4 ms | pure-python field assembly |
| actor + advisory | 0.5 ms | numpy mirror of the TorchScript MLP (was ~4 ms p50 / 10.7 ms p95 through the TorchScript interpreter); mirror is verified against TS at load |
| capture wait | + up to 1 frame interval | 33 ms at 30 fps camera; not in the table above (bench uses pre-stamped frames). Live e2e ≈ 25-55 ms expected. |

Remaining levers, in order of value: 448-px engine (`./export_detector.sh
yolov8n.pt 448`, roughly halves detection), INT8 calibration, GStreamer
zero-copy capture (needs system OpenCV). None needed for the 200 ms target.

## 5. Simulation ↔ prototype observation mapping

(paper table; provenance is logged per-tick in `field_sources`)

| sim observation field | prototype source | provenance |
|---|---|---|
| ego_speed | GPS RMC speed-over-ground (5 Hz); held during dropouts | measured |
| ego_acceleration | least-squares slope of GPS speed (~1 s window) | derived |
| ego_lane | `observation.assumed_lane` (no lane detection in v0) | static_config |
| ego_headway_s | leader_gap / ego_speed (inf when no leader, as sim) | derived |
| target_headway_s | previous tick's commanded headway bin (feedback loop, as in sim) | static/feedback |
| leader_gap, leader_relative_speed | nearest in-corridor track: pinhole distance + dZ/dt slope | measured |
| left/right_lane_front_gap | nearest track with lateral offset ≈ ∓1 lane | measured |
| follower_*, *_rear_gap, rear_required_decel | spec "empty road" values (inf / 0) - no rear sensing | fallback_neutral |
| target_lane_* | = current-lane values (sim defaults target lane to current) | derived |
| active_vehicle_count_local | forward in-range track count ×2 (symmetric extrapolation, `symmetrize_counts`) | derived |
| local_density_bin | sim formula count/(2·range/1000), sim bin edges (12, 30) | derived |
| local_mean_speed_bin | mean(ego + rel_speed) over valid tracks, sim edges (8, 18) | derived |
| local_queue_estimate | tracks with absolute speed < 5 m/s (sim queue_speed) | derived |
| uncongested_low_speed_flag | mirrors `safety/etiquette.py` (density < 12 ∧ v < vf − 8) | derived |
| distance_to_next_merge | 0.0 - **sim parity**: the sim itself hardcodes 0.0 | sim_parity |
| distance_to_downstream_bottleneck | inf (no map matching; sim's off-bottleneck value) | sim_parity |
| time_since_last_lane_change, lane_changes_last_km | inf / 0 (no lane-change detection) | fallback_neutral |
| nearby_av_*, cooperation.* | V2V beacons when enabled; else spec neutral fallbacks (count 0, mean speed = free-flow, pressure/congestion 0) | measured / fallback_neutral |

Encoding (scales, inf clamping, bool handling) is **bit-identical** to
`src/rl/encoders.py` - property-tested in `tests/test_sim_contract.py`.

## 6. Contract vendoring

The Jetson must not import the sim env stack (`src.rl.actions` →
`src.envs.*` → `highway_env`). `policy/sim_contract.py` therefore vendors,
from sim commit `d477dba`:
field lists + FIELD_SCALES + `encode_local_observation` (numpy twin),
action heads/values/forced defaults, `decode_speed_bin` / `decode_headway_bin`,
neutral fallbacks, and `_bin` semantics.

**When the sim contract changes:** update `sim_contract.py` (and
`SIM_COMMIT`), run `python3 -m pytest tests/test_sim_contract.py` on a
machine where the sim imports (encoder tests run everywhere torch exists;
action/wrapper tests need highway_env), then re-export the policy bundle
(`export_policy.py` refuses dim mismatches).

The actor architecture (`backbone.{0,2,4}` + `heads.<name>` state-dict
layout) is likewise mirrored in `export_policy.VendoredActor` and checked by
`test_actor_state_dict_layout_matches_sim`.

## 7. Deviations from plan_deployment.md (and why)

| plan | v0 implementation | rationale |
|---|---|---|
| monocular depth net (Depth Anything small) | closed-form pinhole geometry (ground-plane + width-prior fallback) | a depth net would roughly double the GPU budget; geometry costs ~0.1 ms. Interface (`distance.py`) is swappable for an A/B later. |
| ByteTrack / SORT | SORT-lite (greedy IoU + const-velocity) | sub-ms; adequate for ≤15 windshield vehicles. Upgrade if real footage shows ID churn. |
| `deployment/jetson/logging/` | `logio/` | a local `logging/` package shadows the stdlib for every script in the folder |
| OBD-II reader (`obd_reader.py`) | not implemented | no adapter on hand; GPS speed + hold-on-dropout suffices for v0. Stub path documented in roadmap. |
| TorchScript inference | TorchScript artifact + numpy execution mirror | TS interpreter cost ~4 ms p50 / 10 ms p95 for a 33 KB MLP; numpy is 0.5 ms with no jitter. TS remains the artifact of record and the mirror is verified at load. |

## 8. Extension roadmap

1. **Second (rear) camera** → fills `follower_*` and `*_rear_gap` fields:
   instantiate a second `CameraStream` + `TrtYoloDetector` (one more ~18 ms on
   the same GPU stream budget - measure; consider 448 engine for both),
   a mirrored `DistanceEstimator`, and pass rear vehicles to the builder.
   The observation builder already has the field slots.
2. **OBD-II speed** (`sensors/obd_reader.py`): python-obd over ELM327 BT/USB;
   prefer OBD speed over GPS when fresh; GPS-vs-OBD comparison feeds the
   plan's observation-quality metrics.
3. **Two-unit cooperative demo**: enable `v2v.enabled` on both cars on one
   WiFi hotspot; `nearby_av_*`/`cooperation.*` fields then come live. The
   schema's aggregate-only constraint is honored.
4. **Map matching**: GPS → road segment + distance-to-merge from a preloaded
   GeoJSON of the test route; replaces two sim_parity fields with measured.
5. **Lane detection** for `ego_lane` and better lateral assignment.
6. **INT8 detector** after collecting a calibration set from drive videos.

## 9. Evaluation hooks (plan §"Prototype evaluation metrics")

Everything needed for the paper's tables is in `metadata.jsonl`:
per-tick `stage_ms`/`e2e_ms`/`fps` (system metrics), `vehicles` with
per-track distance/method (perception metrics), `obs` + `field_sources` +
`obs_diagnostics.missingness` (observation quality), `head_probs`/`confidence`
(policy), and `type: system` records with power/utilization from jtop.
`summary.json` aggregates p50/p95; `bench_results.md` is the static-compute
table; replay agreement comes from `replay_summary.json`; `eval_run.py`
turns any run dir into `report.md`/`report.json` + timeline plots with
PASS/FAIL gates.

## 10. Simulated-drive test harness

Closed-loop hardware-free validation: real dashcam footage through the
real detector, with GPS synthesized from a scripted profile.

```
scenario.json ─┬─ video ────────► CameraStream (file:, paced to clip fps)
               ├─ camera block ─► config overrides (fx/horizon/height/hood line)
               └─ gps profile ──► SimulatedGps ──► GpsFix @ 5 Hz
                                   (dead-reckoned, noise, dropouts, cold start)
```

- `SimulatedGps` mirrors `GpsReader`'s consumer surface; the pipeline
  cannot tell them apart. Its core (`GpsSimulator.state_at/fix_at`) is
  pure and deterministic — the evaluator re-instantiates it from the
  profile logged in `metadata.jsonl` (`type: scenario` record) to compare
  observed ego speed against scripted truth (RMSE gate).
- Scripted dropouts just stop publishing fixes, so the builder's
  hold-on-stale path runs exactly as in a real antenna outage.
- Found by this harness and fixed in v0: FFmpeg's VP9 decoder state can be
  poisoned mid-file by one bad cluster (CameraStream now reopens + seeks
  past it, bounded); YOLO boxes the ego hood and its reflections as a
  phantom leader at minimum range (`camera.hood_line_y_px` filter, plus
  ground-plane → width-prior fallback when a bbox bottom is occluded by
  the hood / clipped by the frame edge).
- Honesty limits on borrowed footage: fx rests on an assumed HFOV, so
  absolute distances are order-of-magnitude only (lane assignment and
  closing-speed signs are fx-invariant); ego speed comes from the script,
  not the video, so it won't match the visual motion. Neither limit
  applies to the real calibrated camera + real GPS.
